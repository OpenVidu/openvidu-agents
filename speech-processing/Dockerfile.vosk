# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
# Dockerfile for Vosk offline STT
# Self-contained image with Vosk models for offline speech recognition
# No external API calls required - all processing happens locally
#
# BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
# This Dockerfile requires a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to clone from private repos.
#
# Option 1 - Using GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable:
#   export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
#   docker build --secret id=github_token,env=GITHUB_TOKEN -f Dockerfile.vosk -t openvidu/agent-speech-processing-vosk:main .
#
# Option 2 - Using a token file:
#   echo "ghp_your_token_here" > ~/.github_token
#   docker build --secret id=github_token,src=$HOME/.github_token -f Dockerfile.vosk -t openvidu/agent-speech-processing-vosk:main .
#
# The token needs 'repo' scope for private repository access.
# Generate one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

ARG BASE_IMAGE=openvidu/agent-speech-processing-base:main

# =============================================================================
# STAGE 1: Builder - Install dependencies with GitHub token (isolated stage)
# =============================================================================
# This entire stage is discarded after build. Even if the git config with the
# token were accidentally left in place, it would never reach the final image.
FROM ${BASE_IMAGE} AS builder

# Create a virtual environment for clean package isolation
RUN python -m venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"

# Copy vosk requirements
COPY requirements-base.txt requirements-vosk.txt ./

# Install dependencies using GitHub token for private repo access
# The token is used here and the entire stage is thrown away - no cleanup needed

    if [ -f /run/secrets/github_token ]; then \
        GITHUB_TOKEN=$(cat /run/secrets/github_token) && \

# =============================================================================
# STAGE 2: Final - Clean image with no trace of secrets
# =============================================================================
# Fresh start from base image. Only the virtual environment with installed
# packages is copied. No git config, no shell history, no GITHUB_TOKEN traces.

# These models are immediately available when choosing "vosk" as STT provider
COPY vosk-models ./vosk-models

# Pre-download any ML models or files the agent needs (VAD, turn detector)
# This ensures the container is ready to run immediately without downloading
# dependencies at runtime, which improves startup time and reliability
RUN python main.py download-files

# Change ownership of all app files to the non-privileged user
# This ensures the application can read/write files as needed
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app /opt/venv

# Switch to the non-privileged user for all subsequent operations
# This improves security by not running as root
USER appuser

# After downloading, run in offline mode at runtime
ENV HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1

# Run the application
# The "start" command tells the worker to connect to LiveKit and begin waiting for jobs.
